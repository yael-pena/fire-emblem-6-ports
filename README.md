<img width="479" height="319" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/111470dc-152a-491e-b4ee-c76a74446443" />

A fully overhauled, FE8-engine remake of Fire Emblem: The Binding Blade — rebuilt, rebalanced, and expanded from the ground up.

This project uses the FE8 SkillSystem, ports every FE6 mechanic into FE8, and layers in QoL upgrades, new classes, new portraits, bug fixes, redesigned maps, and a ton of mechanical polish.

If you like FE6, you’ll enjoy seeing how far the game can be pushed.

## Gameplay & QoL Improvements
- Roy promotes early — end of Chapter 16/16x.
- Roy receives a new equippable Fire Emblem weapon (1–2 range magic).
- Lilina is now a Lord.
- Every chapter’s TALK actions now reward EXP or bonuses.
- Prf weapons added for many units to encourage diverse use.
- Healing staves now show heal amount before use.

## Route Changes
The game removes FE6's route splits:
- Automatic Western Isles A Route.
- Automatic Ilia Route.
- Sacae content reworked to still appear.
- All characters from FE6 are now accessible in one playthrough.

## Unit Cap Expansion
Original FE6 allowed ~52 units. This 'remake' supports:
- 60 playable characters
- Plug Tower of Valni & Ruins units
A “Send Home Units” system (Chapter 8x–21x) lets you remove units and get a Spirit Dust for each one sent home. Prevents ROM corruption while expanding roster size.

## Features
- Stat screen redesigned to resemble original FE6.
- Updated class reel showing all classes.
- New and updated animations (including Master Lord Roy by UltraFenix).
- Updated palettes for better match to portraits and official art.
- Multiple new map animations.
- Dozens of updated portraits with corrected colors.
- Skill activation animations added.
- Organized Sound Room and improved soundtrack using FE8 instruments.
